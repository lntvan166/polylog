# Polylog

**One git log across every repository in your workspace.**

Every VS Code git extension gives you a repository *picker*: one repo's history at a time.
Polylog merges them. Every commit from every repository sits in one list, newest first. You
can search and filter all of them at once, and click any commit to see its files in VS
Code's own diff editor.

---

<!-- Media MUST use absolute raw.githubusercontent.com URLs, not repo-relative
     paths: the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX both render this README on their
     own domains and will not resolve `media/...`, so relative links show as
     broken images on the listing pages. The images are excluded from the VSIX,
     so push them to main before publishing. -->

Ticket ACME-142 touched four repositories. Searching for it once in Polylog lists all
four commits, and each one opens in the native diff editor.

## Screenshots

**The merged log.** Every commit from every repo, with a colored chip showing where it
lives. The Changes tree follows your selection, and clicking a file opens its diff above.

**File History.** Right-click any file and choose **Polylog: File History** to get the
commits that touched it, across renames. The diff follows as you step through them with
`↑`/`↓`.

**A branch in every repo.** Type `origin/release-1.4` to see that branch in every
repository that has it. The others fall back to their current branch, and the footer
shows how many repos use each.

**Your theme, not ours.** Every color comes from your VS Code theme, so Polylog looks like
the rest of your editor. That includes light, dark and both high-contrast themes.

## Quick Start

1. Install **Polylog** (extension ID `lntvan166.polylog-git`) in any of these ways:
   - **Extensions view:** search for `lntvan166.polylog-git`, or "Polylog", and pick the
     one by **lntvan166**. Another publisher's unrelated extension is also called polylog.
   - **Quick Open** (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`): `ext install lntvan166.polylog-git`
   - **Command line:** `code --install-extension lntvan166.polylog-git`
   - **Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf:** it is on [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/lntvan166/polylog-git)
     under the same ID.
   - Listings: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lntvan166.polylog-git)
     · [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/lntvan166/polylog-git)
2. Open a folder or multi-root workspace containing more than one git repository.
3. Run **Polylog: Open Merged Log** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` /
   `Cmd+Shift+P`), or click the **Polylog** tab in the bottom panel next to Terminal.

Nothing to configure. Polylog shows every repository VS Code's Git extension has open,
plus any it finds in your workspace folders (up to `polylog.scanDepth` levels deep). Use
`polylog.excludeRepos` to leave some out.

## Features

- **One merged log.** Every repository's commits in one list, newest first by commit
  date, with a colored chip showing each commit's repo.
- **Search across every repo.** Search commit messages (literal, case-insensitive) across
  every repository at once.
- **Filters:**
  - **Authors:** type a name or email. Enter, a comma or a picked suggestion adds it as a
    chip, and a commit by any of the chips matches. Suggestions list who committed
    recently across your repos. **Me** is a toggle inside the box that adds each repo's own
    `user.email`.
  - **Path**: only commits touching a file, a folder (everything inside it), or a glob, in
    every repository at once. Paths are relative to each repo's root. `*.sql` matches in
    any folder; `db/*.sql` only in `db/`.
  - **Branch**, applied in every repo that has it.
  - **Date range:** last 24 hours by default, or 7 days, 30 days, all time, or a custom
    range.
- **Repositories pane.** Pick which repositories to show, with fuzzy search and
  multi-select. Toggle it with **Group by Repository** in the Log's title bar.
  - **↓3 ↑2** beside a name: commits on its upstream you haven't pulled, and commits you
    haven't pushed, as of the last fetch. **Fetch All** (the cloud in the Log's toolbar)
    runs `git fetch` in every repository, a few at a time, and never prompts for
    credentials; Polylog fetches only when you ask. **Show Only Repositories Behind**
    (right-click, or the Log's `…` menu) then ticks just the ones with commits to pull.
    Right-click a repository showing ↓ to **Pull** it: through VS Code's own Git (your
    pull settings, its credential prompts, conflicts in Source Control), or
    `git pull --ff-only` for a repository VS Code's Git does not have open.
  - **Right-click a repository**, in the pane or on any of its commits in the Log: Show
    Only This Repository, Hide from the Log, Show All Repositories, Open Folder in New
    Window, Copy Path, or Exclude from Polylog (adds its path to `polylog.excludeRepos`,
    with an Undo).
- **Right-click a commit** in the Log: Copy Commit ID, Copy Message (the whole message),
  or Open on Remote, its page on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Azure DevOps (from the
  repository's `origin`; credentials in the URL are never opened).
- **Native Changes tree.** Its title says what it shows (`acme-api · 3f9a2c1 · 2 files`, or
  `… · uncommitted · …`). Git status colors and `A`/`M`/`D`/`R` badges. Click a file to
  open its diff in the editor area. Right-click the commit to copy its SHA or message.
  **All Files** (in its title bar) shows the commit's whole tree, like the Explorer: the
  folders holding changes open, each other folder read only when you open it, deleted files
  still listed, and unchanged files opening as they were at that commit.
- **Open File** on any Polylog diff (the title-bar button, or a file's right-click in
  Changes) opens the file as it is in your workspace now, at the same line number.
- **Uncommitted changes, across every repo:**
  - **The Uncommitted view** (in the Polylog side bar, like Source Control: the side-bar button
    in the Log toolbar shows it, and, filled, hides it again): one
    row per ticked repository with uncommitted work, its **Staged** and **Changes** groups,
    files under folders. Hover for **Stage**, **Unstage**, **Discard** (it always asks
    first) and, on a repository, **Commit…**, all through VS Code's own Git, so Source
    Control stays in step. Each file opens the diff Source Control would.
  - **Commits | Uncommitted**, the switch at the top of the Log: its badge counts your
    uncommitted files. The Uncommitted side lists the repositories with work (files, a
    change meter, staged and new tags, when last edited); click one to review its files in
    the Changes tree.
  - Read once in the background after the Log's first page, then kept current by your
    saves and VS Code's Git, one repository at a time.
- **Compare Branches** (the panel button in the Log toolbar, or the Command Palette) opens the
  **Polylog Compare** panel tab, hidden until then; the same button, now filled, hides it again
  (or × in its title): three views side by side. It compares two branches in every ticked
  repository, for example `origin/release-1.4` (◀ left, what you merge from) and
  `origin/main` (▶ right, where it goes).
  - **Repositories** lists the repositories whose files differ, each with its Repo List color and `3 ◀ · 1 ▶ · =1`:
    - **◀**: commits only on the left, which the merge brings in;
    - **▶**: commits only on the right, which the release lacks (a hotfix never brought back);
    - **=**: the same change committed on each side (a cherry-pick), listed under the row.

    Merge commits aren't counted. Repositories that lack a branch are listed at the bottom.
    The title has **Pick Branches…** (VS Code's Quick Pick: recent pairs, favorites, local
    and remote), **Swap**, **Files / Commits** and **Refresh**.
  - **Left** and **Right** show the selected repository's two sides:
    - **Files** (the default): what each side changed since the branches split, as a folder
      tree with your file icons. A file changed on both sides is marked **both**.
    - **Commits**: each side's commits, each expanding to its files.

    Click a file to open its diff in the editor area.
- **File History.** From the Explorer, an editor, a tab, or a file in Changes. Follows
  renames, and always shows every commit of the file: it sets your date range, search and
  author aside while open, and gives them back when you close it.
- **Keyboard first.** The selection drives everything, so you can review a day's work
  without touching the mouse.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓`, `Home` / `End`, `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Move the selection; the changed files follow |
| `Enter` | Open the selected commit's first changed file |
| `/` or `Ctrl/Cmd+F` | Search commit messages |
| `Esc` | Clear the search, then return to the list |

---

**Where things are:** the **Polylog** panel tab holds the Log and the Changes view; the
**Polylog Compare** tab holds Compare; the Uncommitted view is in the Polylog side bar. Drag
any view elsewhere and VS Code keeps it there (views you moved yourself stay put after an
update).

## How It Works

```
 Filters (search · authors · path · branch · dates · repos)
                 │  passed straight through as git log flags
     ┌───────────┼───────────┬───────────┐
  git log     git log     git log     git log      one process per repository,
  acme-web    acme-api    acme-libs   …            16 at a time
     └───────────┴─────┬─────┴───────────┘
                       ▼
          merged by commit date, streamed a page at a time
                       ▼
             Log  ·  Changes  ·  diff editor
```

Polylog has **no index, no cache and no database**. Git does all the searching. Every
filter becomes a `git log` flag (`--grep`, `--author`, `--since`/`--until`, a ref, a pathspec), so each
repository returns only matching commits, and Polylog merges those already-filtered lists.

On a 68-repository, 16,000-commit workspace:

- The full `git log` fan-out takes **25 ms**.
- A message search across all of history takes **640 ms**.
- The first rows appear **0.4 s** after the panel opens.

An index would add a background process and a way to show stale results, for a gain
measured in milliseconds. Typing in a filter waits 250 ms before searching. A new search
stops any `git` processes still running, rather than waiting for them.

Unrelated repositories share no history, so the merge is by commit date. A rebase or a
skewed clock can place a commit out of order.

## Extension Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `polylog.pageSize` | `200` | Commits fetched per repository per page. |
| `polylog.maxConcurrency` | `16` | Maximum number of `git` processes running at once. |
| `polylog.scanDepth` | `2` | Folder levels to search the workspace folders for repositories, in addition to those the Git extension has open. |
| `polylog.excludeRepos` | `[]` | Glob patterns for repositories to leave out, matched against the folder name and full path. |

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| VS Code 1.85+ | Or a compatible editor that installs from Open VSX |
| Git | The same git as VS Code: your `git.path` setting, then the git VS Code's Git extension found, then `git` on `PATH`. Changing `git.path` takes effect at once |

Polylog only reads history. It never runs a command that changes a repository.
